# 🧰 clsUtility — C++ General Utility Library

🔹 A comprehensive and practical C++ utility class that provides a wide range of helper functions for everyday programming tasks.

---

## 📝 Project Description

**clsUtility** is a custom C++ class that gathers many commonly used helper functions into one organized and reusable object-oriented library.

It is designed to reduce repetitive coding by offering ready-to-use tools for random generation, text processing, array manipulation, number operations, and simple encryption.

### 🎯 The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

- Practical utility function design  
- Code reusability and modular programming  
- Implementation of common algorithms from scratch  

This project is ideal for students learning C++ fundamentals and developers who want a reusable toolkit for console applications and small systems.
